*Predicting the class of mushrooms through classification - watch out for those deadly Fly Agarics. Source: 'Walkman200', freeimages.com*


## Intro
In this repo I plan to explore web scraping techniques in order to become more familiar with the coding libraries Beautiful Soup as well as Selenium. The website I plan to scrap was actually designed as a practice site and hopefully has some intentiionally beginner level concepts.

*A fun color-coded bar plot of dataset mushrooms based on color.*


## Project Summary
I found this project to be pretty challenging in the end. I spend a lot of time dealing with HTML tags and bs4.Element.tags which are pretty different than some of the other coding I have done. Though it certainly helped to be familiar with for loops, dictionaries, and pandas dataframes. 


## Repo Contents
This repo contains the following:
* README.md - this is where you are now!
* Web_Scraping_Books.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook containing the finalized code for this project.
* LICENSE - the required license information.
* website url - "http://books.toscrape.com/index.html"
* CONTRIBUTING.md 
* Images


## Libraries & Prerequisites
These are the libraries that I used in this project.
* numpy as np
* pandas as pd
* matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* %matplotlib inline

*Bar plot looking at different mushroom habitats and their class.*


## Conclusions
I was able to scrap the site and pull together a list of books with titles, prices, and ratings.

*Looking at whether mushrooms are edible or not based on odor.*


## Future Work
There is so much more I would like to do - and so many more websites to scrape!
